**[Documentation](https://epydemix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** | **[Website](https://www.epydemix.org/)** | **[Tutorials](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix/tree/main/tutorials)**

**Epydemix** is a Python package for epidemic modeling. It provides tools to create, calibrate, and analyze epidemic models, allowing users to simulate the spread of infectious diseases using different compartmental models, contact layers, and calibration techniques. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [epydemix-data](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix-data/) package to load population and contact matrix data.


## Installation
You can install **epydemix** from either **PyPI** or **conda-forge**. We recommend using a virtual environment (via `conda`, `mamba`, or `venv`) to avoid dependency conflicts.

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install epydemix
```

Add `pip install epydemix[numba]` for a JIT-compiled speedup on the stochastic simulation hot path (optional — epydemix runs fine without it, just slower).

### Install from Conda (conda-forge)

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge epydemix
```

To create a fresh environment and install Epydemix:
```bash
conda create -n epydemix-env -c conda-forge epydemix
conda activate epydemix-env
```

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can start using **epydemix** in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Below an example to get started.

### Example: Creating and running a simple SIR model

```python
from epydemix import EpiModel
from epydemix.visualization import plot_quantiles

# Define a basic SIR model
model = EpiModel(
    name="SIR Model",
    compartments=["S", "I", "R"],  # Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
)

# Add transitions: infection and recovery
model.add_transition(source="S", target="I", params=(0.3, "I"), kind="mediated")
model.add_transition(source="I", target="R", params=0.1, kind="spontaneous")

# Run simulations
results = model.run_simulations(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-04-10",
    Nsim=100,
)

# Extract and plot quantiles of compartment counts
df_quantiles = results.get_quantiles_compartments()
plot_quantiles(df_quantiles, columns=["I_total", "S_total", "R_total"])
```

### Parallel simulations

Set `n_workers` to run simulations in separate processes. Using the model above:

```python
results = model.run_simulations(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-04-10",
    Nsim=100,
    rng=43,
    n_workers=2,
)
```

**Worker counts**

The same `n_workers` settings apply to simulations, calibration, and projections:

| `n_workers` | Execution |
| --- | --- |
| `None` (default) | Sequential, in the calling process |
| Positive integer | That many worker processes |
| `-1` | One worker per available CPU |
| `-2` | One fewer worker than available CPUs |
| `-6` | Five fewer workers than available CPUs |

## Epydemix Data

**epydemix** also provides access to a wealth of real-world population and contact matrix data through the [**epydemix_data**](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix-data/) module. This dataset allows you to load predefined population structures, including age distribution and contact matrices for over 400 locations globally. You can use this data to create realistic simulations of disease spread in different geographies.

### Example of Loading Population Data

```python
from epydemix.population import load_epydemix_population

# Load population data for the United States using the Mistry 2021 contact matrix
population = load_epydemix_population(
    population_name="United_States",
    contacts_source="mistry_2021",
    layers=["home", "work", "school", "community"],
)

# Assign the loaded population to the epidemic model
model.set_population(population)
```

Epydemix can load data either locally from a folder or directly from online sources, making it easy to simulate a wide range of epidemic models on real population data.

For more information about the available population and contact matrices and to download the data, please visit the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix-data/).

## Agent Framework

Epydemix also ships a CLI for driving simulations programmatically — designed for use by LLM agents and automation pipelines, but equally usable from the shell. It covers discovery, config validation, running, and inspecting results end-to-end. See [AGENT.md](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix/blob/agent-framework/AGENT.md) on the `agent-framework` branch for the full contract and worked examples.
